# Advent of Code - Python Solutions
This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code, written in Python (and utilizing a few common libraries for convenience along the way).

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge found at http://www.adventofcode.com/.  Each December, a series of 24 programming puzzles are shared.

This repository contains my solutions in Python.

My input files, as provided by the problems, are included here so you can verify.  You can also clone this repository yourself and change the file inputs to your desired locations.
